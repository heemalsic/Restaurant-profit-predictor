# Restaurant-profit-predictor

Problem Statement:

Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet.

You would like to expand your business to cities that may give your restaurant higher profits.
The chain already has restaurants in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities.
You also have data on cities that are candidates for a new restaurant.
For these cities, you have the city population.

Solution:

To predict the profits of potential cities where the chains could be set up, I have used the Linear Regression Model which outputs the probable profit a city would give. It is one of the most basic machine learning models and comes under Supervised Machine Learning.
